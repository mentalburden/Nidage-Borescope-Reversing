Nidage Borescope Reverse Engineering
====================================

Got one of these for super cheap. Found the SPI flash, gonna dump it tomorrow. DHCP and UDP/8031 are open when the device boots. NC'ed into 8031, but no juice, probably some type of handshaking is required before it start spitting the mjepg stream.
